 AI‑Based Rockfall Prediction & Early Warning System
A cloud‑based SaaS platform that predicts rockfall hazards in open‑pit mines using real‑time weather data, geotechnical parameters, and AI‑assisted risk modeling.
The system provides early warnings, visual analytics, and official forensic PDF reports to support safety‑critical decision making.

1. Problem Statement
Rockfall incidents in open‑pit mines pose severe risks to human life, machinery, and operational continuity.
Traditional monitoring systems are reactive and lack integrated, real‑time intelligence.

2. Proposed Solution
This project delivers an AI‑powered early warning system that:

Continuously evaluates environmental and geotechnical conditions

Predicts rockfall risk levels with confidence scores

Visualizes failure probability over time

Generates government‑style forensic assessment reports

3. Key Features
 Real‑time Weather Integration (OpenWeather API)

4. Multi‑Factor Risk Assessment

Rainfall

Slope angle

Ground vibration

Soil moisture

Wind speed

5. Interactive Graphs

Risk confidence bar

Failure probability timeline

 Map‑based Location Selection

6. AI Assistant (Chatbot) for system guidance

7. Official Government‑Style PDF Report

8. Cloud‑ready SaaS Architecture

9. AI & Risk Modeling Approach
The system uses a weighted risk scoring model, where multiple factors jointly influence the final prediction instead of relying on single hard thresholds.
This approach reflects real‑world geotechnical behavior, where failures often occur due to combined effects.
